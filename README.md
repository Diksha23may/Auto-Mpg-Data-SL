This project focuses on predicting the fuel efficiency of automobiles using the Auto MPG dataset. The model achieved an R-squared score of 0.821, indicating that 82.1% of the variation in MPG can be explained by the model's features. Key steps include:

1.Handling multicollinearity through feature selection.

2.Model validation and performance improvement using p-values to eliminate insignificant features.
